# Techniques

## Kernel exploits

Enumerate the kernel version:

```text
uname -a 
cat /etc/issue
```

Use searchsploit to find matching exploits:

```text
searchsploit linux kernel <version> priv esc

# or you can use https://github.com/jondonas/linux-exploit-suggester-2
./linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl -k <version>
```

## Service exploits

Show processes running as root:

```text
ps aux | grep "^root"
netstat -nl
```

Enumerate program versions:

```text
<service> -v
<service> --version
dpkg -l | grep <service>
rpm -qa | grep <service>
```

Search for exploits

## Weak file permissions

```text
# Find all writable files in /etc: 
find /etc -maxdepth 1 -writable -type f

# Find all readable files in /etc: 
find /etc -maxdepth 1 -readable -type f

# Find all directories which can be written to:
find / -executable -writable -type d 2> /dev/null
```

#### /etc/shadow

1. Crack root hash.
2. Replace original hash with new:

```text
mkpasswd -m sha-512 <newpassword>
```

#### /etc/passwd

1. Delete `x` , works on older systems.
2. Replace `x` with new password hash generated by `openssl passwd "<newpassword>"` .
3. Append new user with UID 0, but different username.

## Backups

Look for interesting files:

```text
ls -la /
ls -la /tmp
ls -la /var/backups
```

## Sudo

```text
# Run a program using sudo:
sudo <program>

# Run a program as a specific user: 
sudo -u <user> <program>

# List programs a user is allowed (and disallowed) to run:
sudo -l
```

Other ways to escalate privileges with sudo:

```text
sudo -s
sudo -i
sudo /bin/bash
sudo passwd
```

## Cron jobs

Located in:

```text
/var/spool/cron/
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/
/etc/crantab
```

The crontab PATH environment variable is by default set to `/usr/bin:/bin`

## SUID / SGID files

```text
find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \;2> /dev/null
find / -user <user> -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

```text
# Running strings against a file:
strings <file>

# Running strace against a command:
strace -v -f -e execve <command> 2>&1 | grep exec

# Running ltrace against a command:
ltrace <command>
```

Privesc strategy

Spend some time and read over the results of your enumeration.

If Linux Smart Enumeration level 0 or 1 finds something interesting, make a note of it. Create a checklist of things you need for the privilege escalation method to work.

Have a quick look around for files in your user’s home directory and other common locations \(e.g. /var/backup, /var/logs\). If your user has a history file, read it, it may have important information like commands or even passwords.

Try things that don’t have many steps first, e.g. Sudo, Cron Jobs, SUID files.

Have a good look at root processes, enumerate their versions and search for exploits.

Check for internal ports that you might be able to forward to your attacking machine.

If you still don’t have root, re-read your full enumeration dumps and highlight anything that seems odd. This might be a process or file name you aren’t familiar with, an “unusual” filesystem configured \(on Linux, anything that isn’t ext, swap, or tmpfs\), or even a username.

At this stage you can also start to think about Kernel Exploits.
